# disk_cleaner_by_percentage
Scan all files in a windows path and delete oldest until the disk has enough free space(percentage specified)

The script also creates an event in the event viewer in windows with the list of files deleted and the percentage of free space before and after.

The use case is to maintain a folder or drive with video files from a camera, oldest files get deleted making room for new footage.
